**Tech stack**

Python, pandas, Scikit-Learn, (CountVectorizer, MultinomialNB, evaluation metrics)

**Specific problem solved**

Last semester, I made a baseline project to analyze sentiment (either positive or negative) for movies using the data I extracted from nltk.movie_reviews using MultinomialNB and NLP techniques, such as vectorization. I approached this project by first preprocessing raw movie comments by using the built - in function of vectorization to convert raw words into analyzable numerical values with the CountVectorizer function from Scikit-Learn library. After obtaining vectorized values, I fed these into the Naive Bayes classifier using 80/20 split and further provided the results, including accuracy, confusion matrix analysis, and such using pandas. 

**Outcome**

The model successfully classified sentiment with reasonable accuracy (81%) for baseline a NLP project. This project strengthened my data science knowledge I had previously learned through a course in university (Introduction to Data Science), including insights regarding NLP pipelines, feature extraction, probabilistic classifiers, and model evaluation. It also reinforced my previous knowledge on how to read model evaluation 

**Note**

This project was implemented as a learning exercise from a guided tutorial from an online resource that was stumbled upon, with full hands on implementation and analysis that was done by myself.
